There will be errors in the code, this code is primarly for personal use

You will need python 3.9 or later

1. On both the server and client(s) run the requirements.bat
2. Set the server_conf.yml to your preferences
3. Set the client_conf.yml to your preferences (make sure the IP matches the server ip)
4. On the server side run the server.py
5. Once the server is up and running run as many clients as possible


I don't plan on updating this code very often or at all. But if you need something fixed or added and you are not bale to do it join my Discord server and send a message to me in the server.
I hope someone else will enjoy this as much as me and dont harp on my terrible code too much please, lol.
